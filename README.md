# Playlistr
A [Soundcloud](http://www.soundcloud.com) playlisting application built with [Backbone](http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&ved=0CCIQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fbackbonejs.org%2F&ei=mW2aUNfLJcfRhAfW1YCoAQ&usg=AFQjCNEQiFXPSOG9TaqO8NIjr09_aBVI1w), [Backbone.Marionette](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette), [Backbone.localStorage](https://github.com/jeromegn/Backbone.localStorage), [RequireJS](http://http://requirejs.org/), the [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) test framework and  [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) for good looks, out-of-the-box.


## Usage

The development environment and build process are handled by [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io).

You will require Yeoman to exist on your system in order to develop or build Playlistr.

To install Yeoman, open up a terminal and enter in the following:

	$ curl -L get.yeoman.io | bash

This will check your system to see what's already installed. You'll need a few things to use Yeoman effectively like NodeJS, Compass, Grunt, and PhantomJS. This script will suggest how to handle installing these dependencies. [More descriptive yeoman install instructions](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki/Manual-Install) are available as well.

Note: Yeoman requires Node 0.8.x currently.

### Development

To launch the local development environment, open up a terminal and enter in the following:

	$ yeoman server
	
### Build

To build the production dist build, open up a terminal and enter in the following:

	$ yeoman build
	
	
### Test

To run the Mocha test suite, open up a terminal and enter in the following:

	$ yeoman test
